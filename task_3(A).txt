there is no better algorithm to follow
simply take input as a string( as the max value of n is very very large)
then add the elements of the string by converting them into integers.
now again convert the sum into string and increment the value of answer
continue the process by writing a recursive function.
when the length of the string becomes 1... stop and print the value of answer.

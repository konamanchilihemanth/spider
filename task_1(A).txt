every number(n) can be represented as the average of its successor(n+1) and its predecessor(n-1)
so first find the positions of rightmost set(1) bit and clear(0) bit. let the positions be B and A respectively.
now, the predecessor of the binary string is given by making the Bth position 0 and all the right elements from B as 1.
similarly, the successor is given by making the Ath position 1 and all the right elements from A as 0.
here the condition is number of digits in the given binary string, predecessor and successor should be same.
this condition is not satisfied for a binary string whose elements are all same.
eg: if the string is 0000, we are not allowed for negative numbers.
    if the string is 1111(4 digits), the greatest number among the two numbers is always greater than or equal to its successor i.e., 10000(5 digits) which will be having more than 4 digits.

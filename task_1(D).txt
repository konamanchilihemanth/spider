calculate the new rating(scored only during contests)
initially new rating is 0. now check if contest happens.
if contest happens.. check for status of SCN.
if he ate SCN increase new  rating by x units.
if he not, then decrease new rating by y units.
after all if new rating is greater than 0 then print "promoted",less than 0 then print "demoted",equal to zero then print "no change"

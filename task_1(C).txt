store the given 6 numbers in a array in descending order.
now ask product of 1 and 2 elements and store it as x
similarly ask for the product of 1 and 3 elements and store it as y.
now search for the element in the stored array which divides both x and y and if found... break the loop.
now store that founded element(k) in the vector v as first element.
also store x/k and y/k as 2nd and 3rd elements.
similarly repeat the process for (4,5) and (4,6).
at last print the vector v.

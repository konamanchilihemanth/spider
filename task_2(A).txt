consider two variables(sum and ans) and initialise them to zero.
now traverse along the string.
if the next element is '<'... increment sum.
if the next element is '>'... decrement sum.
if sum becomes zero... equal ans to sum.
if sum becomes negative... break the loop.
at last print the value of answer.

in this problem, if n=1.. then simply the answer is sum of all elements of the array(a).
but if n=2, then it makes a bit difficult.
here, the answer cannot be greater than sum/2 (where sum is the sum of all elements of the array(a)).
now check whether we can represent sum/2 as sum of some elements of the array(a).
if yes.. print sum/2
if not.. check for its decremented value.
continue till we get yes.

now,checking whether a number k is represented as sum of some elements of the array is done via dynamic programming.
consider a 2-dimensional boolean array(b) with m+1 and k+1 as number of rows and coloumns respectively.
now if b[i][j]=1 then we can represent j as sum of some elements from 0th position to ith position.
here the key points are:
if(a[i]>j)
then b[i][j]=b[i-1][j]
else
b[i][j]=b[i-1][j]||b[i-1][j-a[i-1]]

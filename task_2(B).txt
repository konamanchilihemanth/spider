declare two variables( sum and ans) and initialise sum to zero and ans to n.
declare a structure left which contains the values of left(L) and value(V).
similarly declare a structure right which contains the values of right(R) and value(V).
now declare an array of type left(A) and also array of type right(B).
input the values.
sort the arrays A and B in increasing order of L values and R values respectively.
now traverse along the two sorted arrays(A and B) likewise we do it in the merge sort(divide and conqueror algorithm)

if the elment is a left element... then follow these steps
*** add the value of V to sum.

if the element is a right element... then follow these steps
*** add the value of R to sum
*** compare sum and ans.
*** if sum is greater than ans.. then equal the value of sum to ans.
*** if sum is less than or equal to ans.. then do nothing.
*** after comparision...  subtract the values of R and V fom sum.

continue the traversing.
at last print the value of answer.
